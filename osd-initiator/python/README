This directory contains files that build into a shared module that can
be used by Python programs to use the OSD initiator C library.

File contents.  Many of these parallel their C versions in the directory
above this one:

    pyosd.c - Main entry point for Python, some utility functions
    command.c - A function for each OSD command, plus some getters and
	setters
    attr.c - Attribute type
    device.c - Command submission and retrieval
    drivelist.c - Device identification
    const.c - Initialize a bunch of handy constants in a dictionary

See the module help in Python, and the test .py programs for hints
on how to use this.  It is quite handy for rapidly testing new functions
when writing a new C program would take longer.
