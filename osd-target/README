This directory contains code to build an OSD command processor that uses
SQLite as its attribute storage, and a normal file system (such as ext3)
as its data storage.  It is purely userspace code.  It needs one other
major component, namely the SCSI transport and processing.  This is
provided by stgt, and this OSD Target code is a library that is linked
into stgt's executable.

Major components:

    cdb.c - Main entry point via osdemu_cmd_submit, and parsing for
	all commands and optional setattr and getattr CDB sections
    osd.c - One function for every command, plus some helpers.

    obj.c - Object table manipulation
    attr.c - Attribute manipulation back-end

    coll.c - Collection manipulation
    db.c - SQLite database open, close, query, error handling

    list-entry.c - Pack attributes in list format, used in a few places.
    mtq.c - Multitable queries, whenever more than one table is
	searched
    osd.schema - The schema used to initialize the SQLite database,
	converted into a C file during the build process.
    osd-sense.c - Generating sense (error) return values.
