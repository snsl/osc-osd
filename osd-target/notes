========================================
root object
	partition
		collection
		object
		or any osd object type


questions:
-	how to create osd? flat file? what will be blocks?
-	how is collection populated?
-	where will be attributes stored for an object?
-	

design:
root directory for the root object
each partition is a directory within the root directory
objects are stored within the partition
collection objects are stored within the directory

What is the meaning of the following (p21):

With the exception of attributes pages in the attributes page number range
assigned to any OSD object types, the same attributes page shall not be
associated with more than one OSD object type.
Two object types cannot share same page number but two objects can.
